                <h1>What Is PetFolio ?</h1>
                <p>PetFolio is designed with love and care, especially for pet owners.</p>
                <p>In today’s busy and often stressful work life, many pet owners may find it difficult to keep track of
                    their pets’ care needs. For most of us, our pets are not just animals, they are our biggest source
                    of
                    comfort and are as precious as our own children.</p>
                <p>If you are reading this, it means you have decided to look for a
                    solution. Thankfully, PetFolio is here for you.</p>
                <p>PetFolio is an easy-to-use, friendly, and thoughtfully designed platform that helps you feel
                    confident
                    that your pet is receiving the best possible care. We focused on creating a UI that is gentle on the
                    eyes yet engaging, and we shaped the platform by listening carefully to the experiences and needs of
                    many pet owners just like you.</p>
                <p>Built truly from scratch, PetFolio offers many features created to serve pet owners in the best way
                    possible. We continue to work with passion and care every day to make the platform better for you
                    and
                    your beloved companions.</p>

                <h1>What Makes PetFolio Different From Other Websites ?</h1>
                <p>Before starting this project, our team carefully reviewed many existing websites. What we noticed was
                    clear: most platforms focus on veterinarians, but very few truly support pet owners.</p>
                <p>There was no single place where pet owners could add their pets, track vaccinations, manage monthly
                    care routines, store health information, or save important notes such as allergies or past surgeries
                    all in one system.</p>
                <p>With PetFolio, this is possible.</p>
                <p>You can find the nearest veterinarian and save your appointments using our calendar feature. This
                    way, you never forget an appointment. Your scheduled visits are also sent to your email as
                    notifications, helping you keep a clear record of when each care or treatment was done.</p>
                <p>PetFolio becomes a personal agenda for your pet’s health, so you can always feel organized and at
                    ease.</p>
                <!-- <p>By using our premium features, you can add more pets to your profile, receive personalized expert
                    comments from veterinarians, and access live appointment booking directly through the veterinary
                    system, along with many other benefits.</p> -->

                <h1>Is PetFolio Safe ?</h1>
                <p>Veterinarians can view the information you enter through their own PetFolio accounts. This allows them to provide better care and treatment for your pet, as they have all the necessary information available.</p>
                <p>According to our privacy policy, we do not have the right to view any personal information except your login details. When veterinarians access your pet’s profile, they can only see the information written on that specific pet profile.</p>
                <p>While helping you make the best decisions for your pet, we also place great importance on your security and privacy. Your trust means everything to us. It allows us to improve our platform, grow stronger, and bring PetFolio to pet owners all around the world.</p>
